# AnotherC
This is my simple C language (add auto features in C++), also a small exercise for students to learn PPL - Principles of Programming Language.  
The specification I 'borrow' from my MT22 specification [https://github.com/hieukien503/PPL-HK222/blob/main/assignment_document/mt22-spec-v.1.1.pdf] (about 95%)  
_Note: Code Generation is not complete because of my laziness, so please finish it as an exercise_
