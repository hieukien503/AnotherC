# AnotherC
This is my simple C language (add auto features in C++), also a small exercise for students to learn PPL - Principles of Programming Language.  
The specification I 'borrow' from my MT22 specification (about 95%)  
_Note: Code Generation is not finished since I was very lazy, so please finish it as an exercise_
